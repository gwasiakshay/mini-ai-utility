Large language models are becoming a core component of modern software systems. 
They are increasingly used for tasks such as customer support automation, 
content generation, data analysis, and decision support. 
However, integrating language models into production environments requires 
careful consideration of cost, latency, reliability, and security. 
Developers must design systems that handle failures gracefully, validate model outputs, 
and ensure that sensitive information is not leaked. 
As adoption grows, best practices around prompt design, structured outputs, 
and system observability are becoming essential for building trustworthy AI applications.
